# Early Silly Sims

This folder contains some of my very first Python scriptsâ€”small, playful simulations and mini-games created while teaching myself Python in 2024. Most of these scripts are based on YouTube tutorials and focus on using the `random` library to explore basic programming concepts.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Beginner-friendly code:**  
  Simple, clear scripts that are easy to follow and modify if you're also learning.
- **Random-based simulations:**  
  Most scripts are mini-games or little experiments that use randomness for results (e.g., dice rolls, sports simulations, chance games).
- **Experimentation:**  
  This folder is a sandbox for learning, trying out new ideas, and having fun with code.

## Purpose

These scripts mark the beginning of my journey into Python programming. They're not polished or advanced, but they show my hands-on approach to learning through experimentation and play.

## How to Use

1. Pick any script in this folder.
2. Run it with Python 3 (e.g., `python filename.py`).
3. Read, modify, or expand on the code to keep learning!
