# Early Silly Sims

This folder contains some of my very first Python scripts—small, playful simulations and mini-games created while teaching myself Python in 2024. Most of these scripts are based on YouTube tutorials and focus on using the `random` library to explore basic programming concepts.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Beginner-friendly code:**  
  Simple, clear scripts that are easy to follow and modify if you're also learning.
- **Random-based simulations:**  
  Most scripts are mini-games or little experiments that use randomness for results.
- **Experimentation:**  
  This folder is a sandbox for learning, trying out new ideas, and having fun with code.

## Scripts in this folder

- **98Final.py**  
  A bilingual (English/Portuguese) interactive simulation of the 1998 World Cup Final between Brazil and France. The user picks a team and the match is simulated with random scores for each half.

- **kohli_vs_cummings.py**  
  A one-over cricket simulation featuring Virat Kohli (batsman) vs Pat Cummings (bowler). Each ball's outcome is randomized; the script tracks runs and wickets for a short, fun cricket over.

- **poke-cricket.py**  
  A playful "Pokémon Cricket" game where two teams of Pokémon (“Poke Friends” vs “Poke Evolutions”) play a limited-overs cricket match. Includes random scoring, wickets, and basic scorecards for teams and players.

## Purpose

These scripts mark the beginning of my journey into Python programming. They're not polished or advanced, but they show my hands-on approach to learning through experimentation and play.

## How to Use

1. Pick any script in this folder.
2. Run it with Python 3 (e.g., `python filename.py`).
3. Read, modify, or expand on the code to keep learning!
