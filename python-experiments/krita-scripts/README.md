# Krita Scripts for Tarot Game Image Automation

This folder contains Python scripts developed to automate image editing tasks in Krita, specifically for creating and processing assets for an upcoming tarot game for Playdate.

## Overview

The scripts here were created as experiments and workflow helpers. They leverage Krita's Python API to batch-process images, transform layers, and streamline repetitive editing tasksâ€”saving time and ensuring consistency across game art assets.

### Intended Use

- **Project:** Tarot card game for Playdate console  
- **Tool:** [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) (free and open-source digital painting program)
- **Goal:** Automate image/layer operations for game assets preparation

## Scripts

- Each script is intended to be run inside Krita's Python scripting environment.
- Scripts may include operations such as:
  - Batch exporting layers or images
  - Resizing, formatting, or compositing images for Playdate screen compatibility
  - Applying effects or preparing assets in bulk

## How to Use

1. Open Krita.
2. Go to `Tools > Scripts > Scripter` to open the Python scripting panel.
3. Load and run any of the scripts in this folder as needed.
4. Adjust file paths and parameters inside the script to match your project setup.

> **Note:**  
> These scripts are experimental and may require tweaks based on image structure or Krita version. Test carefully and back up your files!
