# Python Experiments

This folder contains a variety of experimental scripts, utilities, and workflows created for learning, testing, and automating tasks related to game development and digital art.

## Contents

- **krita-scripts/**  
  Automation scripts for [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) using its Python API.  
  - Batch process images and layers, automate asset preparation, and apply filters.
  - Includes a `filters_properties` feature for discovering all available Krita filter properties.
  - Useful for preparing art assets for game projects, inspired by a tarot game for Playdate, but adaptable for any workflow.

- **lua-scripts/**  
  Helper scripts to generate Lua code or data files.
  - Currently includes a script to convert text files (such as those exported from Excel) into Lua dictionary (table) scripts for use in games.
  - Streamlines integration of dialogue, localization, or configuration data into Lua projects.

## General Notes

- Scripts may contain comments and variable names in Portuguese or English, reflecting the context in which they were developed.
- Each subfolder typically includes its own `README.md` with more detailed usage instructions.
- Most scripts are intended for rapid prototyping and personal workflow automationâ€”back up your data before running batch operations!
