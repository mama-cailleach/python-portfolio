# Python Experiments

This folder contains a variety of experimental scripts, utilities, workflows and playful projects created for learning, testing, and automating tasks related to game development and digital art.
See each folder for a README and more details!

## Contents

- **lua-scripts/**  
  Helper scripts for converting text/Excel data into Lua tablesâ€”great for automating data integration into game projects.

- **krita-scripts/**  
  Python plugins and helpers for automating tasks and effects in Krita, especially for card art and batch image editing.

## General Notes

- Scripts may contain comments and variable names in Portuguese or English, reflecting the context in which they were developed.
- Each subfolder typically includes its own `README.md` with more detailed usage instructions.
- Most scripts are intended for rapid prototyping, playful experiments, and personal workflow automation. Back up your data before running batch operations!
