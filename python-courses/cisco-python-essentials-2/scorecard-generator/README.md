## Features

### Modular Design

- **All main match logic split into dedicated Python modules** (`scorecard_generator/`):
    - `models.py` — data classes for teams, players, innings, ball events
    - `team_utils.py` — XI loading and match utility functions
    - `input_handlers.py` — all robust user input and ball-by-ball prompts
    - `game_logic.py` — match/innings logic and event processing
    - `scorecard.py` — scorecard formatting and output
    - `main.py` — entry point for playing a match

### Team Management

- **Interactive team/squad management with `teams_utils.py` in the main folder**:
    - Create/edit teams and squads, enforce unique shirt numbers
    - Add more than 11 players per squad for flexible selection
    - Assign captain and wicketkeeper roles, saved in CSV
    - Select and save starting XIs for matches
    - Teams and XIs saved as CSVs in `teams/`

### Match Play & Scorecard Generation

- **Interactive, robust match input:**
    - Select openers and bowlers from loaded XIs
    - Input every ball (runs, wickets, extras, byes, leg byes, robust no-ball logic)
    - Accurate striker/non-striker swap logic
    - Friendly, error-resilient prompts

- **Professional scorecard output:**
    - Batting and bowling scorecards with correct cricket notation
    - Displays (c) for captain, † for wicketkeeper
    - Handles all edge cases: early over/innings ends, did-not-bat, etc.
    
### Match Simulation

- **Basic match simulator with `match_simulator.py`**:
    - Early prototype/draft for testing scorecard functionality
    - Loads teams from CSV files
    - Uses a simple preset sequence of cricket events or follows provided match data
    - Generates basic match results and scorecards

### Legacy Support

- The old monolithic script is preserved in a `legacy/` folder for historical context.

## Installation

### Installation as a Package

The project can be installed as a Python package:

```bash
# From the scorecard-generator directory
pip install -e .
```

### Manual Setup

Alternatively, you can run scripts directly without installation:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `scorecard-generator` directory
3. Run scripts as shown in the Usage section

---

## Usage

### 1. Team Management & Squad Selection

- **Run the team/squad manager:**
  ```bash
  python teams_utils.py
  ```
  - Create/edit teams and squads
  - Assign captains and wicketkeepers
  - Select and save starting XI for a match
  - Teams and XIs saved as CSVs in `teams/`

### 2. Run the Scorecard Generator

- **Play a match using the modular system:**
  ```bash
  # If installed as a package:
  python -m scorecard_generator.main
  
  # Or, run directly:
  python scorecard_generator/main.py
  ```
  - Loads XIs from CSV
  - Prompts for toss, openers, bowlers, and each ball
  - Shows professional scorecards at innings end

### 3. Run the Match Simulator

- **Run the basic match simulator:**
  ```bash
  python match_simulator.py
  ```
  - Prompts for two team CSV files
  - Simulates a basic match using predefined events
  - Displays scorecards and match result

---

## Team CSV File Format

Teams and starting XIs are stored as CSV files in the `teams/` folder.

**Format:**  
```
number,name,role
16,Jos Buttler,"c,wk"
18,Virat Kohli,"c"
7,MS Dhoni,"wk"
33,Player Name,
```
- `number`: Player's shirt number (unique within team)
- `name`: Full player name
- `role`: Optional (`c`, `wk`, or both as `c,wk`)

Roles are displayed as:
- Captain only: `(c)`
- Wicketkeeper only: `†`
- Captain & wicketkeeper: `(c)†`
- Example:  
  `16 Jos Buttler (c)†`  
  `7 MS Dhoni †`  
  `18 Virat Kohli (c)`

---

## Match Simulation

The `match_simulator.py` script provides a basic match simulation prototype:

- **Current implementation:**
  - Loads two teams from CSV files
  - Simulates two innings with predefined ball events
  - Uses the same core logic as the interactive version
  - Outputs basic match results and scorecards

- **Functionality:**
  - Simple sequence of test events (boundaries, wickets, extras)
  - Basic match result calculation
  - Integration with the scorecard display functions
  - Demonstrates the scorecard generator's capabilities

- **Usage:** Run `python match_simulator.py` and follow prompts to provide team file names

> Note: The match simulator is currently in early development as a proof of concept. It uses a fixed set of events rather than realistic simulation, primarily serving as a test harness for the scorecard generator.

## Changelog / Recent Improvements

- **Full modular refactor:** Logic split into `models.py`, `team_utils.py`, `input_handlers.py`, `game_logic.py`, and `scorecard.py`
- **Robust team manager:** `teams_utils.py` for team and squad management (main folder)
- **Basic match simulator:** Added `match_simulator.py` prototype for testing the scorecard functions
- **Improved input validation:** All ball-by-ball and selection input is robust, clear, and error-resilient
- **Edge case handling:** Striker/non-striker swaps, early over/innings ends, did-not-bat, etc.
- **Package structure:** Added `setup.py` for proper Python package installation
- **Legacy support:** Original monolithic script in `legacy/`

---

## Legacy Version

- The original, all-in-one script (`legacy/scorecard_generator.py`) is included for reference and historical context.
- **All new features and improvements are in the modular version.**
- The legacy file is not maintained or recommended for use.

---

## To Improve / TODO

- Full 20-over support and automatic match result calculation
- Fine tune the correct logic for legal deliveries and possibilities
- Export scorecards to file (txt/CSV/JSON)
- Support for ODI/Test match formats
- More summary statistics and user guidance
- Optional integration with external cricket data APIs
- Unit/integration tests and CI setup
- Web interface for easier use and visualization
- **Project Independence:** Development will continue in a standalone repository separate from this portfolio

---

## Portfolio Note

This project demonstrates:
- **Refactoring from procedural to modular Python**
- **Best practices in user input, data validation, and code organization**
- **Growth as a developer, see both the monolithic and modern modular versions**
- **Python package structure and organization**

While this project was developed as part of the Cisco Python Essentials 2 course portfolio, it has grown beyond its original scope. **Future development will continue in a dedicated repository**, where it will evolve into a more comprehensive cricket statistics and simulation tool with additional features from the TODO list.
