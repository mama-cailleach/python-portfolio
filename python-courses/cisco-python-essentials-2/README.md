## Major Project: Scorecard Generator (In Development)

### Scorecard Generator
An interactive CLI tool to enter teams, ball-by-ball T20 match data, and generate a professional cricket scorecard (batting, bowling, extras, fall of wickets).  
**Status:** _Still in development – actively being improved with new features, error handling, and more!_

- Enter teams (11 players each), select openers and bowlers
- Ball-by-ball T20 input and rules enforcement (overs, wickets, bowler rest, etc.)
- Professional scorecard output (batting, bowling, extras, did not bat, fall of wickets)
- Robust user input validation and error handling
- See [`scorecard-generator/`](./scorecard-generator/) for code and details

## Other Projects

### Calendar Utility
A tool to display and manipulate calendars, check leap years, and calculate date differences. Demonstrates use of Python's `datetime` and `calendar` modules.

### Cricket Scoreboard
A console-based ASCII art cricket scoreboard. Loads match data, displays scores and wickets in large ASCII numbers, and summarizes innings.

### Cricket Stats CLI
A command-line application for analyzing and displaying cricket statistics from match data. Calculates batting, bowling, and partnership stats.

### Guess the Card
A simple CLI card-guessing game. Randomly draws a card and prompts the user to guess its value and suit.

### Train Simulator
Simulates a simple train station and journey manager. Practice with classes, lists, and file input/output.

### Study Folder
A collection of smaller scripts, notes, or experiments created during the course for practice and study.

## How to Run

Navigate into any project folder and run its main Python file.  
Example:
```bash
cd cricket-scoreboard
python ascii_cricket_scoreboard.py
```
Or open and run in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for a cloud-based Python environment.

Each project folder includes its own `README.md` or docstring with more details and extension ideas.
