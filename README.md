# Python Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Portfolio!  
This repository is a collection of my Python projects, scripts, and experiments. It includes work from online courses, self-directed learning, and creative coding. My goal is to showcase my growth and skills as I progress as a Python developer.

## Structure

- **python-courses/**  
  Projects and exercises from structured Python courses (e.g., Cisco Python Essentials, online classes, tutorials).

- **python-experiments/**  
  Personal projects, experiments, games, utilities, and miscellaneous code outside formal courses.
